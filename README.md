internet of things is defined as interconnection of all the physical objects through the use of Internet connectivity and it is one of the most happening field in the current scenario of technology, collection of data from the sensors is one of the basic fundamental task of an iot system. In this project we discuss a   devleopemnt of a system which is related to data acquisition in the scenario of home automation. System makes use of a few sensors to collect data and process the same through a controller (Raspberry Pi) and send the same to a sql server on cloud, so a application or other device can access it. Other available devices in the home automation network can make use of data to make decision which will help the device makers to develop the devices without  the presence sensor unit layer.
